      <p>My name is Mark Brown. I was born in Jamaica and grew up in Miami, Florida. I graduated from Florida International University with a Degree in Geography in 2005. I currently live in Orlando and after years of working in the defense mapping industry, I am now attending the UCF Coding BootCamp. </p>

      <p>How I got to this point is a rather interesting story. My dream in life was always to become an airline pilot. I once attended university to pursue this dream and it was there I realized my love for geography and mapping on a whole. I changed schools to complete a degree in Geography and mapping and it's while working in this field I realize the need for coding skills and that's what brings us here today.</p>
